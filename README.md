Read To Me On The Couch
================

I like to read to my kids. They like to be read to. Sometimes I have to miss story-time.
Luckily, Dad can now be replaced by a robot computer that reads to them in his voice.

This is the future you know.


This app lets you upload your audio for a story, tag different pages, and you get
a nice beep to turn the page. You know, like a read-along book.

In the future, I may let you draw pictures like a story book.
But we are only in the future, not the distant future.


Ya wanna help?
